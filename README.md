# Invisibility Cloak GUI

Computer Vision is becoming highly prominent this days and thereby to learn more about it, I created this small project to create Harry Potter's Invisibility Cloak Effect.

This is a perfect example which shows the power of **OpenCV**. Creating this effect was somewhat easier when you have a specific color in mind and then you can threshold it. However, I wanted to choose a different color at different times; therefore I learned GUI programming in Python using Tkinter. I combined this effect with a GUI so that everyone can use it and create videos from it.

The next step would be to decrease the noise by applying more filters and increasing the Color Thresholding/Masking range
